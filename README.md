# Python_for_DE_MLE_DS
Here, I aim to provide compact yet comprehensive Python fundamentals tailored for Data Engineers, Machine Learning Engineers, and Data Scientists. The contents of this repository include, but are not limited to:

* Primitive Data Types, Python Variables, and Expressions
* Non-Primitive Data Structures: Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries
* Control Flow and Object-Oriented Programming: Conditions, Loops, Functions, Exception Handling, and Classes
* Working with Files
* Methods for Collecting Data in Python, including APIs and Web scraping
* Machine Learning Frameworks

The contents of this repository will be continuously added and updated over time to provide a comprehensive resource for Python learners in the fields of data engineering, machine learning, and data science.
